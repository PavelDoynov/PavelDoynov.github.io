                              The Archbishopric of Trier was one of the most powerful in Germany.  The position held special privileges as it was one of only seven electors who chose the Holy Roman Emperor  and controlled the territory between France and the Rhine. This silver 3 Albus coin of Trier is called a Petermenger.  One side of the coin depicts St. Peter in the clouds holding a key.  The other side has the arms of the Archbishop.  The coin is approximately 23mm in diameter.  Johann Hugo von Orsbeck was Archbishop  Trier from 1675 until his death in 1711. He helped chose Joseph I as the successor to Leopold the Hogmouth as Holy Roman Emperor.   He ruled during  a difficult period of time for Trier.   France, under Louis XIV, repeatedly invaded and occupied Trier.  Johann Hugo issued silver Petermengers from 1691 to 1695 with the date on the front, and again from 1706 to 1709 with the date on the back.

                              These regular issue silver 3 and 5 Mark coins from Prussia features Kaiser (King) Wilhelm (William) II on the obverse and the imperial German Eagle on the reverse. They have a lettered edge "GOTT MIT UNS" (God with us).  Both coins are struck in .900 fine silver.  Wilhelm was both the King of Prussia and the Emperor of Germany. Though he married the eldest daughter of British Queen Victoria, and professed a deep friendship for the British, his impulsive and confused foreign policy and alliances with the Austro-Hungarian Empire brought Germany into the World War I against Britain. After Germany's loss in the war, he was forced to abdicate and lived his remaining days in seclusion in the Netherlands. The 5 Mark is 38mm in diameter coin and contains .8037 troy ounces of silver.  It was issued from 1891 to 1908.  The 3 Mark is 33mm in diameter and contains .4792 troy ounces of silver. It  was issued from 1908 until 1912.   The coins grade Fine to Very Fine.

                              The unification of Germany in 1871 was brought about by the merger of the four independent Kingdoms of Bavaria, Prussia, Saxony and Wurttemberg, along with 22 other Grand Duchies, Duchies, Principalities and Free Cities, under William II, the King of Prussia.  William was given a new title of Kaiser (Emperor) of the German Empire.  The German Empire was called the Second Reich.  The First Reich was the Holy Roman Empire.  After unification, the formally independent states were allowed to issue coins denominated over 1 Mark.  The coins were all struck to the same standards and circulated throughout Germany. We are pleased to offer silver 3 Mark and 5 Mark coins from the four kingdoms that joined to create the German Empire. The coins depict the monarch on one side and the crowned imperial German Eagle on the other.  Beneath the portrait of the monarch is the stateâ€™s mintmark:  Bavaira has D for Munich, Prussia has A for Berlin, Saxony has E for Muldenhutten, Wurttemberg has F for Stuttgart,  The 3 Mark coins are 33m in diameter and contain .4823 troy ounces of silver.  The 5 Mark coins are 38mm in diamerter and contain .8037 troy ounces of silver.
